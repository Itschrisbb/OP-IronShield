# Operation Iron Shield

## By: Khoi Le & Christopher Robinson

# Plot

You, Private Bryan, are part of a reinforcement team (Team Bravo) sent to relieve a forward element (Team Alpha) that is trapped in the town of Zu\`laibar. Team Alpha has missed the designated turn and instead used a turn further to the North side of the town. They were ambushed, as a result, their lead vehicle was heavily damaged by an IED and the insurgents jumped on them from all sides.  
There are also reports of an enemy mortar position somewhere in the West side of this town. We believe that Team Alpha will be shelled to pieces once the enemy realizes they cannot capture members of this team alive.  
Your team’s objectives are:  
Find and neutralize this mortar position before it starts shelling Team Alpha.  
Reach Team Alpha before they run out of supplies and ammunition.  
Team Charlie will be at the back supporting your team.

## Settings 

Due to the systemic corruption in the Bariqistani government, police brutality, and civil unrest; a faction in the Northernmost province calling themselves the Bariq’s Revolutionary Organization (BRO) took up arms and started an insurgency. This corruption also affected the Bariq Royal Armed Forces (BRAF), as their troops are poorly trained and the officers are more interested in their own fame and riches. Over a year of fighting the insurgency, the BRAF has managed to lose control of three Northern provinces. Support for the BRO is growing stronger everyday as fierce fighting continues in the two Central provinces.  
The United Security Alliance (USA) has decided to stabilize the region by deploying troops in Bariqistan in support of its government’s fight against the insurgency. This operation is called Operation Iron Shield, it aims to completely halt the advance of the BRO and improve the fighting effectiveness of the BRAF.

## Tactical Information

Zu\`laibar is a town situated in the middle of the two Central provinces. It is also the midpoint of Highway 117, the only East-West highway that connects these two provinces. Capturing this town and controlling Highway 117 is a crucial start for Operation Iron Shield as it will tremendously slow down the insurgents’ resupply efforts.

# Endings

## Ending 1

**Condition:** Fail all objectives  
Your team (Team Bravo) has to retreat due to heavy losses. Team Alpha suffered heavy bombardment, the survivors were taken as hostages. These hostages are humiliated and broadcasted online. The catastrophic start to Operation Iron Shield resulted in the Operation losing momentum and support of the people back home. The USA completely withdrew all of its troops from Bariqistan within two months of fighting. The Bariqstani government fell shortly after that.

## Ending 2

**Condition:** Fail the second main objective  
Your team managed to neutralize the mortar position but was not able to reach Team Alpha in time. Contact was lost with Team Alpha, and a decision was made for your team to withdraw. After a week of rearm and regroup, your team is now the forward element leading the charge into Zu\`laibar.

## Ending 3

**Condition:** Completed all of the main objectives  
Your team was able to reach and relive Team Alpha. Both teams made a tactical retreat with   
**\[Skipped all optional objectives\]**   
significant losses. After a week of rearm and regroup, Team Alpha and Bravo attacked the town simultaneously in a two-pronged attack. Due to the losses of the first week, the town was bombarded with artillery prior to your reentry. This bombardment managed to thin out the enemy, leading to a swift capture of the town. But it also left most parts of Zu\`laibar in ruins.  
**\[Completed one optional objective\]**  
minor losses. After a week of rearm and regroup, Team Alpha and Bravo attacked the town simultaneously in a two-pronged attack. Due to the losses of the first week, the momentum of this attack was slow. The town is eventually captured but a few high ranking insurgents were able to retreat from the town.  
**\[Completed all optional objectives\]**  
no losses. After a week of rearm and regroup, Team Alpha and Bravo attacked the town simultaneously in a two-pronged attack. The attack was swift and the insurgent forces in Zu\`laibar quickly fell. Valuable intel was extracted from the captured insurgent commanders. 

**\[Destroy the enemy’s mortar position by artillery\]**  
The people of Zu\`laibar did not take kindly to your forces destroying their mosque. They detonated an IED on the way of your convoy to the next town and your vehicle was caught in the blast.  
**\[Destroy the enemy’s mortar position by CQC\]**  
After the capture of Zu\`laibar, your forces moved on to the next town. The USA eventually wins the hearts and minds of the people of this town and Operation Iron Shield continues smoothly.
